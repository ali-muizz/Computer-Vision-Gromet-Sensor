# Summary of Program Functions

This project was done in a group of 6 students for the Toyota Innovator Challenge in April 2022. The idea was to simulate stickers covering car gromets to support the automation of the process in the automotive sector.

This program implements an inspection system to verify the presence and coverage of stickers applied over holes. The program captures an image from a webcam, processes it using computer vision techniques, and utilizes machine learning models to predict the class labels of the stickers. The inspection criteria include confirming the presence of all 7 stickers, ensuring full coverage of body holes, and checking for wrinkle-free stickers. The program outputs the predicted class labels for each sticker.
